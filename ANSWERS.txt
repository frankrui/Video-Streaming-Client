=== Observed behaviour ===

Describe in general words the observed behaviour of each of these servers and 
how it affects the video playback experience. Then explain what you believe is
happening and what is causing the described behaviour.

* FUNKY A
There seem to be infrequent barely noticeable jumps during the video. It is possible that some frames are
missing.

* FUNKY B
There are often brief jumps throughout the video, more than in FUNKY A. This may have more frames missing
compared to FUNKY A.

* FUNKY C
The video frames seem to be out of order in this playback as the video keeps going back and forth.

* FUNKY D
This one looks to be a combination of both FUNKY B and FUNKY C as there are frequent jumps and the 
frames are mixed up.

* FUNKY E
The video is working properly but it is just sped up. Server sending frames too fast (high frame rate) but
no packet loss.

* FUNKY F
The video is working properly but it is slowed down. Server sending frames too slow (low frame rate) but 
no packet loss.

* FUNKY G
The video is slowed down with some barely noticeable jumps. Server sending frames too slow plus some go 
missing.

* FUNKY H
The video is at normal speed but this time the random pauses are slightly longer compared to the rest of 
the funky servers. This might be due to a larger chunk of the frames going missing.
