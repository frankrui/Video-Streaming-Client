=== Observed behaviour ===

Describe in general words the observed behaviour of each of these servers and 
how it affects the video playback experience. Then explain what you believe is
happening and what is causing the described behaviour.

* FUNKY A
There seem to be infrequent barely noticeable jumps during the video. It is possible that some frames are
missing.

* FUNKY B
There are often brief jumps throughout the video, more than in FUNKY A. This may have more frames missing
compared to FUNKY A.

* FUNKY C
The video frames seem to be out of order in this playback as the video keeps going back and forth.

* FUNKY D
This one looks to be a combination of both FUNKY B and FUNKY C as there are frequent jumps and the 
frames are mixed up.

* FUNKY E
The video is working properly but it is just sped up. Server sending frames too fast (high frame rate) but
no packet loss.

* FUNKY F
The video is working properly but it is slowed down. Server sending frames too slow (low frame rate) but 
no packet loss.

* FUNKY G
The video is slowed down with some barely noticeable jumps. Server sending frames too slow plus some go 
missing.

* FUNKY H
The video is at normal speed but this time the random pauses are slightly longer compared to the rest of 
the funky servers. This might be due to a larger chunk of the frames going missing.

* STATISTICS TAKEN FROM movie.Mjpeg ONLY

=== Result of analysis ===

Explain in a few words what you believe is actually happening based on the statistics above.

* FUNKY A: Some packets are being lost here and there but usually not in huge chunks so jumps are barely
noticeable. This gives the lower frame rate due to lost packets as well as a low packet loss rate.

* FUNKY B: More packets are being lost every where and now the jumps are noticeable. This gives an even
lower frame rate due to lost packets compared to FUNKY A as well as a higher packet loss rate.

* FUNKY C: All packets were sent successfully and frame rate is normal. Only thing is that the packets
were not sent in order which resulted in a high rate of frames out of order. This gives off the shaking
camera feel to the video.

* FUNKY D: This server did not send the packets in the correct order and also lost some packets during
delivery. This led to a low frame rate as well as a high packet loss rate and frame out of order rate.

* FUNKY E: This server sent the packets way too quickly and as a result the client could not receive them
properly. Hence, many packets were lost and the video shortened by a great amount. This led to the high
frame rate as well as a very high packet loss rate.

* FUNKY F: This server sent the packets very slowly but successfully. As a result the video time dragged
on for longer than normal resulting in the lower frame rate.

* FUNKY G: This server sent the packets slowly while also loosing some packets in the process. This
increased the play time and resulted in an even lower frame rate than FUNKY F due to lost packets.

* FUNKY H: This server lost packets at the same rate as FUNKY A however it may be loosing them in chunks
rather than all over the place, thus resulting in longer than normal jumps.
