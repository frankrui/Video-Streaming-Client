[ /4]	All required files are provided as specified and Java files compile properly       
[ /2]	Establishes a connection with the RTSP server                                      
[ /4]	SETUP – creates a valid datagram socket with a randomly chosen port                
[ /4]	SETUP – sends a properly formatted request
[/4]	SETUP – correctly receives a response and parses the session number from it        
[/4]	SETUP – correctly handles responses with a response code different than 200        
[/4]	PLAY – sends a properly formatted request                                          
[/2]	PLAY – starts the timer responsible for receiving frames                           
[/4]	PLAY – correctly receives a response                                               
[/2]    Correctly handles play being pressed while currently playing                       
[/4]	PAUSE – sends a properly formatted request

[/4]	TEARDOWN – sends a properly formatted request                                      
[/4]	TEARDOWN – correctly receives a response                                           
[/4]	TEARDOWN – stops the frame timer and closes the datagram socket                    
[/4]	Correctly closes the RTSP connection on close                                      
[/3]	Correctly handles an unexpected connection interruption


PART B [  /36]

[/4]	Funky scenarios are reasonably explained and justified
[/4]	Stats for funky scenarios are similar to produced values
[/4]	Reasonable summary of funky scenarios and the problems that cause them
[/4]	New “smooth” program works correctly for regular scenario                          
[/4]	Reorders delayed packets                                                           
[/4]	Buffers frames arriving too fast and plays them at the correct speed               
[/4]	Buffers frames arriving too slow and plays a snippet a time at correct speed       
[/4]	Reasonable approach (or explanation) for dealing with lost packets                 
[/2]    Does not assume an infinite amount of space to buffer frames. (Sends a pause when 
        buffer space is full and resumes before empty?)                                  
[/2]   Recognizes that the buffer is essentially the producer consumer problem and takes steps
        to ensure race condition on buffer doesn't occur.                                


General comments [ /13]

[ /4]  Added code is appropriately commented, indented etc.                              
[ /6]  Appropriate data structures are selected and resonable algorithms                  
       employed.
[ /3]  Marker's discretion.
